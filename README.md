# Git Practice

I recently came across [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/technology/prevent-cyberattack-linux.html) when I was doing research for a Journalism project. The project entailed searching for coverage of cybersecurity and cyberattacks to see how the media was able to cover complex subjects they might not have background knowledge about. This particular article concerns a hidden backdoor found by a software engineer. 
Adding more for practice here.

Lucia Song: This is a very interesting article! I think this just goes to show how even the most protected software can have weaknesses, and you cannot assume it is safe just because of its size and credentials.
