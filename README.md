*Article I Find Interesting*

A few months ago, I came across [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/technology/prevent-cyberattack-linux.html?searchResultPosition=5) on the NYT
while working on a project for a Journalism course. I was doing research on cyberattacks for a short project on how the media covers technical terms they may not 
know too much about. This particular article covers a Software Engineer who discovered a hidden backdoor and was able to prevent a massive cyberattack.
